abstract: In this paper, we provide a framework for designing interval observers possessing desired stable and positive error dynamics to achieve state estimation of nabla Caputo discrete fractional order linear time--invariant (LTI) systems in the presence of model uncertainties. Specifically, the basic conceptions and criteria of stability and positivity for such fractional order systems are derived systematically. Using these properties, a classic Luenberger-type interval observer is developed directly. Given that it is usually nontrivial even impossible to obtain an appropriate gain matrix, a more general interval observer design method is given by using the coordinate transformation technique. Finally, some simulated cases including a fault detection related example are developed to validate the usefulness and practicality of the framework.
